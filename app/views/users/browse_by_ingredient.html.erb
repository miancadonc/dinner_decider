<h3>Your ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
    <% user_ingredients(@user).each do |ingredient| %>
    <%# I have absolutely no idea why, but adding uniq to user_ingredients makes the links appear. Since I wanted to add it anyway, it's no problem, but it is really weird. %>
    <%# The method user.ingredients returns the ingredient from each recipe_ingredient, so there are duplicates. That's why I was going to use uniq anyway. Still very odd %>
    <%# Also, this page and the browse_by_tag page are very similar and could probably be abstracted %>

            <%= link_to "#{ingredient.name}", user_ingredient_path(@user, ingredient) %>
