# Dinner Decider

This simple web app allows the user to save recipes, including ingredients, descriptions, instructions, and tags. The recipes have full crud functionality and can be tagged, adn tags and ingredients can be browsed. Importantly, the app also functions to help a user choose a recipe, allowing for a random sample of three recipes to be generated, and also for various types of recipe browsing.

### Prerequisites

There are several gems listed in the gemfile, including rails, omniauth, and bcrypt for example. Running `bundle install` in the terminal should install everything necessary to run the app if you don't have them already.

### Installing

As stated above, fork and clone the repository from github.com/miancadonc/dinner_decider, then run the migrations. The app should now be functional. Run `rails c` in terminal to use locally.
